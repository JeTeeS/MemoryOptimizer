## How it works

This system will take your parameters and mark them as unsynced in the parameter list. Instead it will cycle through them and use parameter drivers to sync each parameter. If the change check option is enabled it will use blendtrees to find when a parameter changes and sync that change for faster syncing.

This system does have some limitations. The syncing time will be delayed compared to if you would sync the parameter normally, so it's not ideal for time sensitive applications. Also, with the change check option enabled, the system can get stuck on a certain step of the cycle and not sync the other parameters (See [**Sync Steps**](https://github.com/JeTeeS/MemoryOptimizer#sync-steps)).

## Install guide

- Add [MemoryOptimizer](https://vpm.jetees.dev) to the VRChat Creator Companion (VCC)
  - For a guide on how to add it to VCC, [see this guide](https://notes.sleightly.dev/community-repos/)
- Add MemoryOptimizer to the Unity Project using the "Manage Project" option in VCC
- Select `Tools > TES > MemoryOptimizer` from the top toolbar to open the MemoryOptimizer window
- Click **Optimize** next to each parameter to be optimized
  - See [**How to use**](https://github.com/JeTeeS/MemoryOptimizer#parameters-selection) for what kind of parameters to select
- Select an amount of syncing steps to generate with
  - See [**Sync Steps**](https://github.com/JeTeeS/MemoryOptimizer#sync-steps), most of the time this can be left at 2 or 3 steps
- Select whether to enable/disable [Change Check](https://github.com/JeTeeS/MemoryOptimizer#change-detection)
- Click the `Install` button!

## How to use

### Parameter Selection

This system works by only syncing a few parameters at a time, so by the very nature of the system not all parameters can be optimized. Consequently, some advanced systems like [15-Bits-Position-Rotation-Networking](https://github.com/VRLabs/15-Bits-Position-Rotation-Networking) can not be optimized by this system. That being said, most things should work just fine!

To select a parameter, simply click the "Optimize" button.

- ðŸ”´ If the button is red, that means the parameter is not selected.
- ðŸŸ¡ If it's yellow, the parameter is selected, but will not be optimized.
- ðŸŸ¢ If it's green, the parameter will be optimized when you click "Install".

 Try changing the amount of [**Sync Steps**](https://github.com/JeTeeS/MemoryOptimizer#sync-steps) to get as many parameters optimized as possible!

### Change Detection

Change Detection will detect and prioritize recently changed parameters before continuing to resync other parameters for more responsive interactions.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling Change Detection requires at least 3 sync steps

It is not advised to enable Change Detection for parameters that are constantly updated.

If a parameter is changing more often than the total sync time, the MemoryOptimizer system may stay frozen updating that parameter due to Change Detection.

Examples of parameters that are frequently updated include:

- Parameters updated via OSC such as Face Tracking
- Continuously incrementing parameters such as RGB floats

> [!NOTE]
> This option may have a significant performance impact at higher parameter counts, so it is better decrease step count to improve sync latency if possible.

### Sync Steps

Sync steps are the amount of steps the system divides your params into to sync them. A higher number will take longer to sync, but will take up less parameter space (depending on how many parameters are selected of each type).

It is generally recommended to have as few sync steps as possible, as the more steps you have the longer the system will take to completely sync. Try changing this number to see if you save significantly more or less space with your selected parameters.

> [!NOTE]
> By default the sync steps slider is limited to 4 steps, but this can be unlocked in the settings.
